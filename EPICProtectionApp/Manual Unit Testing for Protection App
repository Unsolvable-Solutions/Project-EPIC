Manual Unit Testing(Mobile data currently cannot be switched on and off):
We tested the functions manually on a Sony Xperia Z1 and Samsung S3. Here are the following tests and their results:

1) The phones wifi and Bluetooth were switched on. We called the StoreSnapshot function and the result was that both were turned off.
   We then called the LoadSnapshot function and both the Wifi and bluetooth were turned on again. Test 1 passed.
   
2) The phones Wifi was turned on but the bluetooth turned off. We called the StoreSnapshot function and the result was that the wifi
   was turned off. We then called the LoadSnappshot function and only the Wifi was turned back on again. Test 2 passed.
   
3) The phones bluetooth was turned on but the Wifi turned off. We called the StoreSnapshot function and the result was that the
   bluetooth was turned off. We then called the LoadSnapshot function and only the bluetooth was turned back on again. Test 3 passed.
   
4) Both the Wifi and bluetooth were turned off. Calling StoreSnapshot changed nothing. Calling LoadSnapshot changed nothing. Test
   4 passed.
   
5) Testing the NFC intent, we held an NFC tag with data against the phone. The app opened and the displayed the tags data. Test 5 passed.

Manual UnitTesting (Mobile data currently cannot be switched on and off) for Demo 2:
We tested the functions manually on a Sony Xperia Z1. This proccess cannot be automated as changes to the functions need to be made inorder
to facilitate it.
