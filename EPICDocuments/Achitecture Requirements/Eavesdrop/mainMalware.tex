	\subsection{Project Background}

The Android Operating System officially took over the smart phone market in 2010 and it is suspected that about 700 000 Android devices are used in South Africa. It is mostly the corporate or more upper class communities that have access to these smart phone devices. It is also these individuals who sit in the big corporate meetings where extremely sensitive data can be discussed. For this reason, if these individuals could have eavesdropping malicious software(malware) on their smart phone, it could cause sensitive data to be easily leaked out.


		\subsection{Project Vision}
The aim of the malware is to eavesdrop on a person via their own smart phone. This is done by live streaming the conversation from the infected smart phone to a remote server which plays back the stream and saves a local copy of the recording on the server.
		\subsection{Project Scope}
The malware consist of a web server that connects with the mobile device via a web socket. A request is send from the server to the application on the mobile device to start recording. The mobile device will start to stream live to the server which in turn plays back the stream and creates a local recording.
