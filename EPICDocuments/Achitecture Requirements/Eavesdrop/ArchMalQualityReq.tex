\section{Quality Requirements}
\subsection{Scalability}
%iets van die server kan meer as een  foon/device opvang tot en met ?? devices
%Ook dit kan verewig aanhou record? tot die geheue vol is. -> moet dalk iets soos 'n uur limit maak
%\item{Malware} :
The server can handle multiple connections at a time of which a list is created. One device can then be selected from the list from which the live stream will be requested. The server can only handle one live stream recording at a time.

\subsection{Performance}
The malware application will have a minimal effect to the application it is embedded in such that it is almost invisible. The server will have a number of devices connected but only one device can stream at a time. I will have a minimal effect on the host machine. There is a limit on the recording time as the device will record until the user stops the recording. 

\subsection{Reliability and Availability}
The malware application will be reliable because if the user closes the application the malware will run as a background task.

\subsection{Portability}
The malware server is easily portable as it can run on any computer running java.
