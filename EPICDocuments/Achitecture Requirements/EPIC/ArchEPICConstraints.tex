\section{Architecture Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Mobile application can only be used on Andriod version 4.4 and 5.1. This is because HCE has been introduce from Android version 4.4. These version are currently the only two version above 4.4 which can turn off mobile data automatically (Google removed ability to turn it off in version 5.0.1). There is currently no API (Application Program Interface) that allows developers to turn it off automatically.
		\item The Node can only communicate with one device at a time.
		\item The Node can only work if the specific Mobile Application is installed.
		\item The Edison can only be connected to three Nodes maximum at a time.
